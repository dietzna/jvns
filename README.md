Project Motivation and Goals:
The purpose of this project is to develop an application that enables users to discover and analyze trends and insights from a vast collection of Amazon book reviews. The application will provide users with a range of statistics about specific books, authors, or publishers. Additionally, it will feature records of past reviews from individual reviewers. Our aim is for this application to help users uncover new books of interest and delve into patterns related to their preferred authors or publishers.
Application Description & Functionality:
Our website has been designed with a range of features to support our main goal, distributed across different pages. Key functionalities include discovery, search, filtering, and display. The discovery aspect is highlighted by a 'book of the day' feature, which introduces users to books they might not have known about. The search and filtering tools on the main pages (home, authors, users, and publishers) allow users to delve deeper into areas they are interested in. Additionally, essential statistics are prominently displayed on each page, providing immediate insights to anyone visiting the website.
